* Patrick Presto

Previously I worked at a fortune 500 as a **Director of the global infrastructure** team.<br>
**Supported 23 private DC** and given a direction to moving workloads to the 3 major public clouds<br>
took a **life and shift** approach using our onprem architecture, os images, monitoring solutions, leveraged existing processes, etc...<br>
It was Painful, we had to redo all of it, and **we learned a lot!** <br>
One of our **Biggest take aways** was how unprepared we were **to address todays security requirements** for running our services in the cloud<br>
We took a lot of liberties with our more traditional security model and were forced to mature quickly<br>
We looked at a couple enterprise tools, We chose 1.  Long story short.  I now work for the company.
